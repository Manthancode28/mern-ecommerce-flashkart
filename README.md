## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Manthan Nimonkar** – a final-year IT student who’s passionate about full-stack web development.
FlashKart is one of my key projects where I’ve applied the **MERN stack** to build a complete e-commerce application — from user authentication and product management to cart flow and responsive UI.
I enjoy working on both frontend and backend, and I’m always looking to improve my skills by building practical, scalable web apps.
